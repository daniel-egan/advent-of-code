## Possible Languages

1. TypeScript
   - Typing system works well
   - Good amount of tooling around it within VSCode
1. Python
   - Dislike whitespace to determine when inside a function
   - Good amount of tooling
   - Simple to write/understand
1. Ruby
   - Simple to read/write
   - Feels verbose
   - Although doesn't use whitespace can be difficult to see what is inside a function
1. PHP
   - Good tooling within VSCode
   - Some odd quirks but relatively simple to read/write
1. Lua
   - Similar to Ruby with verbosity
   - Pattern matching is nice but isn't full RegEx so might require extra steps
   - Goto feature can be nice to skip certain portions of code, but might cause issues in following what code does without a debugger
   - Good debugging within VSCode
1. Perl
   - Cannot get debugging to work so having to resort to print statements
   - Appears that no VSCode formatter works
   - Having $,@,% to determine variable types is confusing, something you could get used to but feels very odd at first
   - This is probably the hardest puzzle so far
1. Gleam
   - Also doesn't appear there is any debugging solutions for VSCode
   - Seems like there is no official file input or output, having to use a 3rd party package
